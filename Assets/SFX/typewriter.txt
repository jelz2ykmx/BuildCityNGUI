These sounds are based on following two sound recordings:

http://freesound.org/people/eklee/sounds/158058/

http://freesound.org/people/eklee/sounds/158057/

Extracted for http://opengameart.org/forumtopic/key-press-sounds

Available as flac 48000 Hz and wav 44100 Hz.

I recommend Audacity (graphical) and SoX (command line) for audio conversion, editing and mixing.
