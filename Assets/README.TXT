Thank you for your purchase! 

We've put **thousands of hours** into making this kit for developers like you to build their own mobile strategy games. If you have a moment, please take just one minute to write a review on the Unity Asset Store:

We read every review!

This kit contains many features you'll find in popular mobile city building and strategy games. Although in our Strategy Kit, we've improved the classic Clash of Clans formula with a few of our own ideas. :)

Please take your time and read the documentation. Ask us if you have questions.

Everything is 100% editable. This kit contains the full source code as an example game. You can run it right now. Save a backup copy and look through the documentation while examining the scripts. There are at least 4000 lines of code in our basic kit, and >20000 lines of code in our Complete Kit.
